description: Money New is a cognitive financial community integrating stock dashboards, notes, and options learning.
---

**The financial market has never been just a stage for suits and ties.** It is a proving ground where cognition, insight, and ways of thinking collide. Here, the quality of decision-making matters far more than identity.

And **Money New** is built for those who are willing to think, dare to record, and enjoy validating their views.

The financial market is not mysterious. Its mystery may simply come from the lack of visualization, transparency, and communicable thinking frameworks.  
When data is seen, recorded, and discussed, I believe **the market becomes understandable, trackable, and tradable**.

And this is Money New's mission.

## Product Vision

Use data visualization and cognitive recording to help everyone build their own financial decision-making system. If it gets difficult, you can focus on recording data while leaving decision-making and analysis to powerful artificial intelligence.

Money New is not just a market-watching tool, but a field for learning, thinking, and personal growth.

## Main Features

- **Stock Dashboard** — Display global market trends with minimalist design  
- **Options Content** — Use documentation to help you understand the language of volatility and risk from scratch  
- **Thinking Notes** — Record and review every market insight  
- **Community Exchange** — Share views, validate logic, build cognitive advantages (TODO)

## Quick Start

1. **Create Account** — Log in with email or Google account  
2. **Add Stock Cards** — Search and bookmark the targets you follow  
3. **Data-Driven** — Use visual charts to track market changes and validate your judgment  
4. **Record Views** — Write down your judgments and reasons in notes  
5. **Join Discussion** — Exchange ideas with community members, correct or strengthen cognitive models (TODO)

**The flow of money reflects the update of human cognition.**  
Every learning, every record, every thought,  
brings us closer to "smarter wealth flow."

## Join the Community

Money New is building a **data-driven financial learning community**.

We believe that **cognition creates wealth** — every record, validation, and review is a step toward becoming a mature investor.

I hope this community can become a handy tool on your investment journey,  

accompanying you to find your own rhythm and method in the noise of the market.  

Registration is considered joining.
If time and opportunity are right in the future, we may hold offline exchange activities in Shenzhen.  
Everything is as it comes, but if it really happens — you will receive an email notification.  

> "Those who understand the market don't need to chase quotes;

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

### 1. Why is there a 15-minute delay in stock card data?

Yes, to avoid misleading, this is specifically stated here.

When you view asset targets in Money New's canvas, **data in real-time mode has about a 15-minute delay**.  

The reason is simple: **0-delay market data is not free, it can even be very expensive**. To get real-time quotes from NASDAQ or NYSE requires formal data authorization and paid interfaces.

In fact, this is also an "industry practice" in the financial industry. On the brokerage side, the data displayed without opening an account also has delays.

Currently, this project is still independently developed and maintained by me personally, and I cannot afford such high fees for the time being. Even if real-time data is purchased, it would require a lot of time to redesign and render the chart system.

However, as a **learning and review tool** rather than a high-frequency trading terminal, the 15-minute delay has minimal impact on users understanding market trends and recording thoughts.

After all, the stock market is not a 24-hour transaction. You can start your review and recording on a closed afternoon or a lazy weekend.
 
If you **do have a strong need for real-time data** and are willing to bear the related costs, you may contact me via private message or email for **paid consultation**. In the future, with the growth of the community and the abundance of resources, I also plan to **open source the Money New platform** at the right time, and then you may be able to access real-time quotes yourself to achieve a more complete market experience.

### 2. Why is there a Money New platform?

Strictly speaking, **this is not a marketing project, but an extension of a cognitive experiment.** The original intention of Money New is very simple: I encountered some problems when trading and learning, and these problems may be common. Therefore, I want to create a space that allows thinkers to understand the market with "data" and "records".  

As the homepage of technical documentation, it is not suitable to expand too much product story. Therefore, I will record some ideas, thoughts and practices about Money New in the Blog later, and the link will be updated here after it goes online.

Special thanks to **[CodeBuddy](https://www.codebuddy.ai/)** for its support and help. The birth of Money New is inseparable from its diligent execution as an "AI Coding Agent". From inspiration to prototype, from script to interaction, every step is like a dialogue with your own thinking.  

It is both a productivity tool and a mirror, allowing me to re-understand the meaning of so-called **Vibe Coding**.
