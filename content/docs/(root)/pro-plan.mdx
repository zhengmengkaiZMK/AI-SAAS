What? You actually want to pay? Great, you are my good friend.  

But —  
**This product is still some distance from my ideal complete version.**  
So I'm not comfortable taking your money yet.  

However, if you are interested in the following features,  
you can register an account first,  
and when the features go live, I will notify you via email first.  

## Upcoming Features

### 1. RSS Feed Sync
Want to follow a public account, financial media or blogger?  
Pro plan supports custom RSS subscriptions to automatically sync the latest content to your Money New canvas.  
**One sentence explanation:** Let you "see the world" while watching the market.

### 2. Video Cards  
Upload and host your videos to review directly in the canvas.  
Suitable for recording trading reviews, technical teaching or market thinking.  
**One sentence explanation:** Market emotions are also worth recording.

### 3. AI Stock Analysis  
Based on your canvas data, let AI automatically help you:  
Draw trend lines, mark support levels, provide strategy suggestions.  
**One sentence explanation:** Let AI be your rational partner, not an emotion booster.

### 4. Content to Podcast / Podcast to Text  
Sometimes you want to listen rather than read.  
Pro plan will support one-click conversion of notes to podcasts, and vice versa to convert podcasts to text notes.  
**One sentence explanation:** Make learning methods more free.

### 5. Option Cards
This will be one of the features I'm most looking forward to.  
It is an **interactive teaching tool** designed specifically for learning and understanding options.  
You can simulate option buying and selling, profit and loss curves, time decay and other effects in the canvas,  
and intuitively understand "what is an option", "how to trade", "how key variables affect returns".  

Of course, this feature is very difficult to develop —  
it involves not only complex calculation logic, but also requires access to real option data sources.  
So I need some time to polish it.  

**One sentence explanation:** Make options no longer just formulas, but "understandable" charts.

### 6. Your Feature Proposal  
If the feature you want happens to be **a feature that a group of investors want** —  
then I will most likely consider productizing it.  

## Price Preview

The pricing range will roughly fall in **$6.9 ~ $9.9 / month**.  
This number hasn't been decided yet, and may be adjusted according to the number of features and server costs.  
If you have suggestions, please let me know.  
Your feedback may directly determine the direction of the next version.

## Finally

Money New is an experiment in cognition. **The Pro plan is not "pay to unlock features", but an invitation to "build the product together".**  

Thank you for your willingness to support. When I polish the product to be more presentable, I will offer you a worthy product. ☕️
