## What Are Mental Models?

Mental models are frameworks that help us understand how things work. For product managers, they're essential tools for making better decisions faster.

## Essential PM Mental Models

### 1. Jobs to Be Done (JTBD)

People don't buy products—they "hire" them to do a job.

<Callout>
**Example**: People don't buy a drill because they want a drill. They buy it because they want a hole in the wall.
</Callout>

### 2. The Kano Model

Features fall into three categories:

| Category | Description | Impact |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| Basic | Expected features | Dissatisfaction if missing |
| Performance | More is better | Linear satisfaction increase |
| Delighters | Unexpected features | Exponential satisfaction |

### 3. ICE Scoring

Prioritize features using:
- **Impact**: How much will this move the needle?
- **Confidence**: How sure are we about the impact?
- **Ease**: How easy is this to build?

```
ICE Score = (Impact × Confidence) / Ease
```

### 4. The 80/20 Rule (Pareto Principle)

80% of results come from 20% of efforts. Focus on the high-leverage activities.

## Applying Mental Models

<Steps>

### Choose the Right Model

Different situations call for different frameworks. Don't force-fit a model.

### Test Your Assumptions

Mental models are simplifications. Validate them with data.

### Combine Models

Use multiple models together for deeper insights.

### Teach Your Team

Shared mental models improve team communication and decision-making.

</Steps>

## Conclusion

Mental models aren't magic formulas—they're tools for thinking more clearly. Build your toolkit, but remember: the map is not the territory.
