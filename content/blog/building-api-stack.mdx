## The Modern API Landscape

APIs have become the backbone of modern software development. Whether you're building a mobile app, web service, or integrating third-party services, a solid API stack is essential.

## Essential Components

### 1. API Design

Start with a clear design using OpenAPI (Swagger) specification:

```yaml
openapi: 3.0.0
info:
  title: User API
  version: 1.0.0
paths:
  /users:
    get:
      summary: Get all users
      responses:
        '200':
          description: Success
```

### 2. Development Tools

<Callout>
**Recommended tools**: Postman for testing, Insomnia for GraphQL, and Thunder Client for VS Code integration.
</Callout>

### 3. Authentication & Security

Implement proper authentication using JWT or OAuth 2.0. Never store sensitive data in plain text.

## Best Practices

1. Version your APIs from day one
2. Implement rate limiting
3. Provide comprehensive documentation
4. Use proper HTTP status codes
5. Design for scalability

## Testing Strategy

Write integration tests for your API endpoints. Use tools like Jest, Supertest, or Postman's test runner.

```javascript
describe('User API', () => {
  it('should return all users', async () => {
    const response = await request(app).get('/api/users')
    expect(response.status).toBe(200)
    expect(response.body).toBeInstanceOf(Array)
  })
})
```

## Conclusion

Building a robust API stack requires careful planning and the right tools. Start simple, iterate, and always keep your consumers in mind.
