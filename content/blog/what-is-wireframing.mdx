## Understanding Wireframes

Wireframing is the process of creating a visual guide that represents the skeletal framework of a website or application. It's a crucial step in the design process that helps teams align on structure before diving into high-fidelity designs.

## Why Wireframe?

Wireframes serve several important purposes:

- **Clarify features and functionality**: Define what goes where
- **Facilitate communication**: Create a common language between stakeholders
- **Save time and money**: Catch issues early in the design process
- **Focus on UX**: Remove distractions of color and style

## Types of Wireframes

### Low-Fidelity Wireframes

Simple sketches or basic digital layouts focusing on:
- Layout structure
- Content placement
- Basic navigation

### High-Fidelity Wireframes

More detailed representations including:
- Accurate spacing and sizing
- Realistic content
- Interactive elements
- UI components

## Best Practices

<Steps>

### Start with User Flows

Map out the user journey before creating wireframes.

Get feedback on wireframes before moving to high-fidelity designs.
